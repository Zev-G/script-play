$Act 1 The Prologue
{CHORUS}: What’s alchemy? The hoax of charlatans? Or mystic quest for stuff of life itself: eternal search for the Philosopher’s Stone, where mingling and unmingling opposites, transforms base metals into precious gold. Hence, scientific metaphor of self: divide the mind’s opposing archetypes — if you possess the courage for the task — invite them from the shadows to the light; unite these lurking shards of broken glass into a mirror that reflects one soul. And in this merging of unconscious selves, there lies the mystic “marriage of true minds.”
[He takes the discarded objects from the wastebasket and replaces them on the desk as:]
Swift Mercury, that changing element, portrayed as Gemini, hermaphrodite and twin, now steers the stars of Constsance Ledbelly, and offers her a double-edged re-birthday.
[He picks up the Manuscript from the wastebasket and replaces it on the desk. An unintelligible inscription on the cover is now apparent]
Here is the key to the Philosopher’s Stone —
[Indicates Manuscript]
the psychic altar that will alter fate.
But she has not the eyes to see it… yet.
[The CHORUS butts out his cigarette on the floor next to her desk and exists as:]

$Act 1 Scene 1
{CONSTANCE}: Pen ... [She searches, then finds her pen behind her ear] "Romeo and Juliet and Othello: The Seeds of Corruption and Comedy." Of all Shakespeare's tragedies, Othello and Romeo and Juliet produce the most ambivalent and least Aristotelian responses. In neither play do the supposedly fate-ordained deaths of the flawed heroes and heroines, seem quite inevitable. Indeed, it is only because the deaths do occur that they can be called inevitable in hindsight, thus allowing the plays to squeak by under the designation, "tragedy." In both plays, the tragic characters, particularly Romeo and Othello, have abundant opportunity to save themselves. The fact that they do not save themselves, tends to characterize them as the unwitting victims of a disastrous practical joke. Insofar as these plays may be said to be fatalistic at all, any grains of authentic tragedy must be seen to reside in the heroines, Desdemona and Juliet. [A sheaf of papers slides under the office door. CONSTANCE goes to the door and stoops to pick them up just as they begin to slide out again. A little tug of war ensues. Suddenly the door opens against CONSTANCE's head. She stands up to see a young female STUDENT]
{STUDENT}: I'm sorry Miss Ledbelly, I thought you were out.
{CONSTANCE}: Oh. Um. I’m in.
{STUDENT}: I put the incorrect date on my essay.
{CONSTANCE}: Oh. What's today?
{STUDENT}: It's the first.
{CONSTANCE}: The first what?
{STUDENT}: Of the month.
{CONSTANCE}: Oh. [STUDENT hands essay back to CONSTANCE]
{STUDENT}: I know it's a week past the due date but [Lying] you remember the extension you gave me, eh? 
{CONSTANCE}: I did?
{STUDENT}: Yes, because I've been ill lately. [Cough-cough]
{CONSTANCE}: Oh yes, well, whatever, that's fine.
{STUDENT}: Thanks Miss Ledbelly.
{CONSTANCE}: Wha — uh, what was this assignment?
{STUDENT}: "The Effect of Filth on Renaissance Drama."
{CONSTANCE}: Good. That sounds just fine Julie, uh Jill uh . . . keep up the good work.
{STUDENT}: Thanks, Miss. By the way, I like your hair like that. It's really pretty. 
{CONSTANCE}: Oh. [She vaguely touches her hair below the toque] Thanks. [Exit STUDENT. CONSTANCE closes the door then, stiffing the student's essay into her bookbag] Lie thou there. Now where was I? [She takes a bite of Velveeta and settles down to work] Uh, At . . . At the tragic turning point in Othello even the hardened fatalist is at pains to suppress a cry of warning, id est, "O Othello, O Tragic Man, stop your ears against the false yapping of that cur, lago. The divine Desdemona, despite her fascination with violence and her love of horror stories, and aside from the fact that she deceived her father to elope with you, is the very embodiment of purity and charity." [CONSTANCE opens her Shakespeare, oblivious to OTHELLO and IAGO who enter and play out the following scene which she reads silently to herself] 
{IAGO}: My Lord Othello, *Did Cassio, when you wooed' Desdemona, know of your love?*
{OTHELLO}: *He did from first to last, Iago. And went between us very oft.*
{IAGO}: *Indeed?*
{OTHELLO}: *Indeed?, Ay, indeed! Discern’st thou ought in that? Is he not honest?*
{IAGO}: *Honest, my lord?*
{OTHELLO}: *Honest? Ay, honest.*
{IAGO}: *My lord, for aught I know.*
{OTHELLO}: *What dost thou think?*
{IAGO}: *Think, my lord?*
{OTHELLO}: *Think, my lord? By heaven thou echo’st me, as if there were some monster in thy thought too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something. If thou dost love me, show me thy thought.*
{IAGO}: *My lord, you know I love you.*
{CONSTANCE}: We are willing to accept Iago’s effortless seduction of Othello unto foaming jealousy — the Moor is, after all, an ageing warrior, in love with honour and young Desdemona — [Constance turns a page of Shakespeare. Back to OTHELLO and IAGO]
{OTHELLO}: *Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore! Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof.*
{IAGO}: *Tell me but this: Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?*
{OTHELLO}: *I gave her such a one; ‘twas my first gift.*
{IAGO}: *I know not that; but such a handkerchief — I am sure it was your wife’s — did I today see Cassio wipe his beard with.*
{OTHELLO}: *If it be that —*
{IAGO}: *If it be that, or any that was hers, it speaks against her with the other proofs.*
{OTHELLO}: Had Desdemona *forty thousand lives! One is too poor, too weak for my revenge. Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her! Damn her! O! I will chop her into messes! Cuckold me!*
{IAGO}: *O, ‘tis foul in her*
{OTHELLO}: *With mine officer!*
{IAGO}: *That’s fouler*
{OTHELLO}: *Get me some poison, Iago, this night.*
{IAGO}: *Do it not with poison. Strangle her in bed, even the bed she hath contaminated.*
{OTHELLO}: *Good, good! The justice of it pleases. Very good! Now art thou my lieutenant.*
{IAGO}: *I am your own forever.* [OTHELLO and IAGO embrace, then exit]
{CONSTANCE}: - but we cannot help suspect that all might still so easily be set to rights; and there's the rub! For it is this suspicion which corrupts our pure experience of fear and pity at a great man's great plight, and — by the end of the handkerchief scene — threatens to leave us, frankly ... irritated. [CONSTANCE sips her beer just as the door bursts open. Another young female student, RAMONA, stands in the door-way', all business and very assertive]
{RAMONA}: Hi Professor, my name is Ramona.
{CONSTANCE}: I'm not actually — I'm, I'm just an Assistant Professor. [CONSTANCE suddenly remembers her beer, and conceals it]
{RAMONA}: Oh. Well, I wonder if you could pass on a message to Claude for me.
{CONSTANCE}: Claude? Oh, you mean Professor Night?
{RAMONA}: Yes. Just tell him I won the Rhodes.
{CONSTANCE}: Congratulations . . . Ramona.
{RAMONA}: Thanks. But the way, Coors beer is part of the right-wing infrastructure that has brought this hemisphere to its knees. 
{CONSTANCE}: Oh. Sorry. It . . . was a gift. [Exit RAMONA. CONSTANCE picks up her beer, goes to throw it away, looks around, then drains it furtively and pitches it into the wastebasket] In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare sets the stage for comedy with the invocation of those familiar comic themes, love-at-first-sight, and the fickleness of youth. But no sooner has our appetite for comedy been whetted, when Tybalt slays Mercutio, and poor Romeo proceeds to leave a trail of bodies in his wake. [CONSTANCE turns another page of her Shakespeare. Enter TYBALT and MERCUTIO]
{TYBALT}: *Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo —*
{MERCUTIO}: *Consort? What Tybalt, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my fiddlestick; [Indicates sword] here's that shall make you dance. [Enter ROMEO] *
{TYBALT}: *Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford no better term than this: thou art a villain.*
{ROMEO}: *Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting. Villain am I none. Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.*
{TYBALT}: *Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.*
{ROMEO}: *I do protest I never injured thee, but love thee better than thou canst devise till thou shalt know the reason of my love; And so, good Capulet, which name I tender as dearly as mine own, be satisfied .*
{MERCUTIO}: *O calm, dishonourable, vile submission! [Draws] Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?*
{CONSTANCE}: If only Romeo would confess to Tybalt that he has just become his cousin-in-law by marrying Juliet. Such is our corrupt response that begs the question, "Is this tragedy?!" Or is it comedy gone awry, when a host of comic devices is pressed into the blood-soaked service of tragic ends? 
{TYBALT}: *[Draws] I am for you.*
{ROMEO}: *Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.*
{MERCUTIO}: *Come sir, your passado!* [TYBALT and MERCUTIO fight]
{ROMEO}: *Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio! [TYBALT, under ROMEO’s arm, thrusts MERCUTIO in, and files] Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.*
{MERCUTIO}: *Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arm. A plague a’both your houses!* [MERCUTIO exits and dies. Enter TYBALT]
{ROMEO}: Alive *in triumph, and Mercutio slain? [He draws]*
{TYBALT}: *Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here, shalt with him hence.* [They fight. TYBALT falls]
{ROMEO}: *O, I am fortune’s fool!
{CONSTANCE}: What if a Fool were to enter the worlds of both Othello and Romeo and Juliet? Would he be akin to the Wise Fool in King Lear?: a Fool who can comfort and comment, but who cannot alter the fate of the tragic hero. Or would our Fool defuse the tragedies by assuming centre stage as comic hero? Indeed, in Othello and Romeo and Juliet the Fool is conspicuous by his very absence, for these two tragedies turn on flimsy mistakes — a lost hanky, a delayed wedding announcement — mistakes too easily concocted and corrected by a Wise Fool. I will go further: are these mistakes, in fact, the footprints of a missing Fool?; a Wise Fool whom Shakespeare eliminated from two earlier comedies by an unknown author?! Non obstante; although a Fool might stem the blundering of Othello and Romeo, the question remains, would he prove a match . . . [She pops the cigarette butt between her lips and hunts for a match] for Desdemona and Juliet? Or are these excellent heroines fated to re-main tragedies looking for a place to happen? [Having failed to find a match, she tosses the cigarette butt into the wastebasket, then opens the ancient Manuscript. It is the same length and width as foolscap. She becomes momentarily absorbed in it, trying to decipher it, turning it every which way] Nevertheless. I postulate that the Gustav Manuscript, when finally decoded, will prove the prior existence of two comedies by an unknown author; comedies that Shakespeare plundered and made over into ersatz tragedies! It is an irresistible — if wholly repugnant — thought. [Enter CLAUDE, CONSTANCE gets spooked] Ah-h-h! 
{CLAUDE}: Heh-heh-heh, got you again Connie.
{CONSTANCE}: Heh. Oh Professor Night, you scared the daylights out o fme.
{CLAUDE}: You must learn to relax, my little titmouse. You’re working too hard. Speaking of which… have you got something for me? [CONSTANCE stares at him for a moment too long before answering]
{CONSTANCE}: Yes. It's here somewhere. [She begins rummaging. CLAUDE picks up her green-ink thesis. He shakes his head. CONSTANCE surfaces from her desk with a thick essay, also handwritten in green ink on foolscap. She sees that he is reading her thesis. She shoots out her hand involuntarily and snatches it from him] Don't read that! ... sir ... the ink's not dry. [She stuffs her thesis into a drawer of her desk. He wipes his green ink-stained fingers on his handkerchief] 
{CLAUDE}: Still harping on the Gustav Manuscript are you? I hate to see you turning into a laughing stock Connie. You know you'll never get your doctorate at this rate.
{CONSTANCE}: I know . . . I guess I just have a thing for lost causes.
{CLAUDE}: You're an incurable romantic Connie. 
{CONSTANCE}: Just a failed existentialist.
{CLAUDE}: Traipsing after the Holy Grail, or the Golden Fleece or some such figment.
{CONSTANCE}: Whoever cracks the Gustav code will be right up there with Darwin, Bingham —
{CLAUDE}: And Don Quixote. The best tenured minds in the world have sought to translate it for the past three hundred years. What gives you the notion you're special? 
{CONSTANCE}: Oh I'm not, I'm, I'm not the least bit special, I'm, I'm just one flawed and isolated fragment of a perfect infinite mind like anybody else, I — I think that I exist in that you and I are here chatting with the sense evidence of each other, insofar as we're not over there not chatting, no I'm not special — unique maybe, in the, in the sense that a snowflake is unique, but no more valuable than any other flake . . . It's just that I, I did win the Dead Languages Prize as an undergraduate, and it would be a shame to hide my light under a bushel. 
{CLAUDE}: [Concealing his curiosity] Say you did crack these obscure alchemical hieroglyphs; what if they turned out to be a grocery list or some such rubbish? 
{CONSTANCE}: I think it's source material that Shakespeare wanted to suppress yet preserve.
{CLAUDE}: And I suppose you've feverishly identified a whole raft of anagrams to support this heresy?
{CONSTANCE}: As a matter of fact, yes. If you take the second letter of the eighteenth word of every second scene in Othello, and cross reference them with the corresponding letters in Romeo and Juliet, it says: "I dare not name the source of this txt."
{CLAUDE}: “txt”?
{CONSTANCE}: Well, "text." I'm missing the letter, "e," it was probably deleted in a later printing.
{CLAUDE}: Your fascination with mystery borders on the vulgar, I'm afraid.
{CONSTANCE}: I can't help it. I'm a fallen Catholic. It's left me with a streak of "whodunit."
{CLAUDE}: Well who did dun it? What became of this mysterious source material?
{CONSTANCE}: I think Shakespeare gave it to his elderly friend, Gustav the alchemist, to shroud in an arcane code, and that's what's in here.
{CLAUDE}: [Amused] Oh Connie. You have such an interesting little mind.
{CONSTANCE}: Thank you sir.
{CLAUDE}: Hand it over. [CONSTANCE thinks he is referring to the Manuscript] No, ye gods forfend, not that decrepit tome. The —ahem — your latest commission. 
{CONSTANCE}: Oh, the essay. Here you go. I hope I've destroyed Professor Hollowfern's book to your satisfaction.
{CLAUDE}: I'm sure it's up to your customarily dizzying standard. Did you remember to give yourself the usual thanks for "irksome proofing of the text"?
{CONSTANCE}: [Beet red] In point of fact sir, I took the liberty of dedicating it to myself.
{CLAUDE}: That's awfully sweet of you Connie. [Looks at essay] Tsk tsk tsk your hand gets more cryptic all the time. Like the tracks of some tiny green creature. I do wish you'd learn to type, my dear. I'm weary of doing my own typing, and I daren't trust anyone else with our little secret.
{CONSTANCE}: I'm working on it sir, but my fine motor skills are really poor.
{CLAUDE}: [Still scanning the essay] Indeed.
{CONSTANCE}:  I'm ready for my next assignment Professor. I've sharpened my nib to a killing point. [They share a malicious chuckle]
{CLAUDE}: And dipped it in venom to paralyze the academic foe with one poisonous phrase? [More chuckling]
{CONSTANCE}: Just name your victim.
{CLAUDE}: Connie. There remains but one thing you can do for me.
{CONSTANCE}: Oh? ... What's that? [He takes a small velvet box from his pocket, opens it, and shows her]
{CLAUDE}: Tell me ... do you like it?
{CONSTANCE}: Oh Professor Night — 
{CLAUDE}: Claude.
{CONSTANCE}: Oh Claude . . . it's the most beautiful diamond I've ever seen.
{CLAUDE}: Dear Connie. Thank you. I'm the happiest man in the world.
{CONSTANCE}: So am I. I can't quite believe it!
{CLAUDE}: Neither will Ramona.
{CONSTANCE}: Ramona? . . . Oh.
{CLAUDE}: I'm going to miss you Connie.
{CONSTANCE}: Am I going somewhere?
{CLAUDE}: I am, pet. I've decided to take that lecturing post at Oxford myself. Even if it does fall somewhat short of a challenge.
{CONSTANCE}: Oh. I thought you might recommend someone less distinguished, say an Assistant Professor, for that job.
{CLAUDE}: That's what I thought too until Ramona won the Rhodes. Now it's Oxford for the both of us, eh what?
{CONSTANCE}: What about — Will I still work for you? I'm afraid not love. I made full Professor today, so the pressure's off.
{CONSTANCE}: Congratulations.
{CLAUDE}: Not to worry. I've lined up a lovely post for you in Regina.
{CONSTANCE}: Thanks.
{CLAUDE}: What's your schedule like day after tomorrow? I hoped you'd help pack my books.
{CONSTANCE}: I'd love to but . . . that's my birthday . . . and I planned on going to the zoo.
{CLAUDE}: Birthday eh? Chalk up another one for the Grim Reaper. Still twenty-nine and holding are we? Well, many happy re-runs. [Chuckle] I've got to dash. I'm addressing the Literary Society this evening — which reminds me! [But CONSTANCE has anticipated him, and hands him another sheaf of inky green foolscap]
{CONSTANCE}: Here's your speech.
{CLAUDE}: Thanks old girl. [He tugs the pom-pom on her toque then exits with:] Oxford ho! [CONSTANCE slowly pulls off her toque and drops it into the wastebasket. She is in shock. This is the nadir of her passage on this earth]
{CONSTANCE}: Regina. I hate the prairies. They're flat. It's an absolute nightmare landscape of absolutes and I'm a relativist, I'll go mad. Diamonds are a girl's best friend. Diamonds are harder than a bed of nails. I can't feel anything. I'm perfectly fine. I'll call the Dean and resign. I'll go back to my apartment and watch the plants die and let the cats copulate freely. I'll order in groceries. Eventually I'll be evicted. I'll smell really bad and swear at people on the subway. Five years later I run into Professor Night and Ramona: they don't recognize me. I'm selling pencils. They buy one. Suddenly, I drop dead. They discover my true identity. I'm awarded my doctorate posthumously. Professor Night dedicates his complete works to me and lays roses on my grave every day. My stone bears a simple epithet: "Oh what a noble mind is here o'erthrown." . . . There's no time to lose! I have to start right now if I'm going to sink that low in five years. [Grabs phone, dials] Hello, give me the office of the Dean! . . . Oh yes, I'll hold. [While holding, she surveys the objects on her desk, picks them up one by one, addresses them, then tosses them into the wastebasket] The bronze wings that my Brownie pack gave me. [Reads inscription] "To the best Brown Owl in the forest." I flew up more girls than any Brown Owl other than Lady Baden Powell. [Toss. Picks up a jar that contains something like an anchovy] My appendix. It was removed in the summer of love when the rest of my family went to Expo '67. The doctor gave it to me in this baby food jar. He thought it would cheer me up. It did. [Toss. Takes the plumed fountain pen from behind her ear] The fountain pen I made from my parakeet, Laurel. She used to sing "Volare." She fell five stories and died instantly. [Goes to toss it away, but cannot bear to do so. She replaces it behind her ear, where it stays for the rest of the play. Picks up the Manuscript] And this — my fool's gold. Silent mocking oracle. I'll do the world a favour. [CONSTANCE goes to toss it in the wastebasket but her gesture is suddenly arrested in midair and she stares, spell-bound, at the inscription on the cover. Harp music and light effects. She blinks and tries to focus, as though the inscrip-tion were swimming before her eyes with a disorienting effect. CONSTANCE reads the inscription aloud:] "You who possess the eyes to see this strange and wondrous alchemy, where words transform to vision'ry, where one plus two makes one, not three; open this book if you agree to be illusion's refugee, and of return no guarantee —unless you find your true identity. And discover who the Author be." [CONSTANCE hesitates for a moment, then opens the Manuscript. Pages fall out. Warp]
{CHORUS}: You've witnessed an impossible event: a teacher, spinster — "old maid," some would say — whose definition of fun and excitement is a run of "ibids" in an essay, disappears before your very eyes. Suspend your disbelief. Be foolish wise. For anything is possible, you'll find, within the zone of the unconscious mind. [His head disappears back into the wastebasket. During the scene change]
{IAGO}: *Think, my lord?*
{OTHELLO}: *Think, my lord? By heaven thou echo’st*
{IAGO}: *Indeed?*

$Act 2 Scene 1

{IAGO}: *Tell me but this: Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?*
{OTHELLO}: *I gave her such a one; ‘twas my first gift.*
{IAGO}: *I know not that; but such a handkerchief — I am sure it was your wife’s — did I today see Cassio wipe his beard with.*
{OTHELLO}: *If it be that —*
{IAGO}: *If it be that, or any that was hers, it speaks against her with the other proofs.* [CONSTANCE’s head peeks out from behind an arras]
{OTHELLO}: Had Desdemona *forty thousand lives! One is too poor, too weak for my revenge. Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her! Damn her! O! I will chop her into messes! Cuckold me!*
{IAGO}: *O, ‘tis foul in her*
{OTHELLO}: *With mine officer!*
{IAGO}: *That’s fouler*
{OTHELLO}: *Get me some poison, Iago, this night.*
{IAGO}: *Do it not with poison. [IAGO hands a pillow to OTHELLO] Strangle her in bed.*
{CONSTANCE}: No! [Both OTHELLO and IAGO turn and stare at her, amazed] Um . . . you're about to make a terrible mistake .. . m'Lord. [Shocked, and at a loss for words to explain her statement, CONSTANCE gathers her courage and timidly approaches IAGO] Excuse me please. [She plucks the handkerchief from IAGO’s hose and gives it to OTHELLO]
{OTHELLO}: Desdemona's handkerchief! [To IAGO] Which thou didst say she gave to Cassio!
{IAGO}: Did I say that? What I meant to say —
{OTHELLO}: O-o-o! I see that nose of thine, but not that dog I shall throw it to!
{IAGO}: My lord, I can explain —
{CONSTANCE}: Omigod, what have I done? [She grabs the handkerchief from OTHELLO and tries unsuccessfully to stuff it back into IAGO'S pocket] Look, just forget you ever saw me here, okay?! [She grabs the pillow and offers it to OTHELLO] Here. [OTHELLO ignores the pillow and proceeds to bind and threaten IAGO] [Aside] I've wrecked a masterpiece. I've ruined the play, I've turned Shakespeare's Othello to a farce. O Jesus, they've got swords! And this is Cyprus; there's a war on here! O please wake up. Please be a dream. I've got to get back home! Back to my cats. They'll starve. They'll eat the plants. They'll be so lonely. [To OTHELLO] Please! I've got to go! Where's the exit!? 

{OTHELLO}: Stay!!!
{CONSTANCE}: Sure.
{OTHELLO}: Forty-thousand lives were not enough to satisfy my debt to you, strange friend. I'd keep you on this island till I knew which angel beached you on our war-like shores, and how you gained fair knowledge of foul deeds.
{CONSTANCE}: Well. Actually. I've studied you for years.
{OTHELLO}: You must be a learned oracle. I'd have you nightly search the firmament, and daily read the guts of sheep for signs to prophesy our battles with the Turk.
{CONSTANCE}: I only know of your domestic life.
{OTHELLO}: And of the murd'rous viper in my breast. My shame is deeper than the Pontic sea, which yet would drown in my remorseful tears, whose crashing waves are mute before the trumpet cry of this atoning heart would tumble Jericho!
{CONSTANCE}: Oh well, I wouldn't dwell on it too much. You'd never have been jealous on your own.
{OTHELLO}: Oh yes, I had forgor. [To IAGO] ‘Twas all thy fault. [To CONSTANCE] If that you be the mirror of my soul, then you must learn the story of my life: *of moving accidents by flood and field, of hairbreadth scapes i’th’ imminent deadly breach, of being taken by the insolent foe —
{CONSTANCE}: Oh yes, I know.
{IAGO}: [Aside] So know we all the wag and swagger of this tale.
{OTHELLO}: In Egypt, kicked I sand into the eyes of infidels who thought I made a truce when I did give to them a pyramid on wheels they pulled into the garrison. But I had packed it full with Christian men, who slit the savage throat of every Turk.
{CONSTANCE}: That sounds like Troy.
{IAGO}: [Aside] Not Troy, but false.
{CONSTANCE}: And Desdemona fell in love with you, because she loved to hear you talk of war.
{OTHELLO}: These things to hear she seriously inclined.
{CONSTANCE}: I've always thought she had a violent streak, and that she lived vicariously through you, but no one else sees eye to eye with me. Yet I maintain, she did elope with you, and sailed across a war zone just to live in this armed camp, therefore — [Aside] He's not a Moor.
{IAGO}: [Aside] Amour? Ah-ha! C'est ca! Et pourquoi pas?! [A flourish of martial music]
{OTHELLO}: *Here comes the lady. Let her witness it.* [Enter DESDEMONA attended by a SOLDIER who carries her needlework]
{DESDEMONA}: O valiant general and most bloody lord!
{OTHELLO}: *O my fair warrior!*
{DESDEMONA}: *My dear Othello!*
{CONSTANCE}: *Divine Desdemona!*
{OTHELLO}: My better self. [OTHELLO and DESDEMONA embrace]
{IAGO}: [Aside] And my escaped prey. I'll trap thee yet.
{DESDEMONA}: *That I love my lord to live with him, my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world.* My sole regret — that heaven had not made me such a man; but next in honour is to be his wife. And I love honour more than life! Who's this? [Everyone turns and stares at CONSTANCE]
{CONSTANCE}: Hi . . . Desdemona? . . . This is like a dream .. . You're just as I imagined you to be. [CONSTANCE, in awe, reaches out to touch the hem of DESDEMONA 's sleeve and fingers it throughout her next speech] I'm Constance Ledbelly. I'm an academic. I come from Queen's. You're real. You're really real. 
{DESDEMONA}: As real as thou art, Constance, Queen of Academe.
{CONSTANCE}: Is that my true identity? Gosh. I was just a teacher 'til today.
{DESDEMONA}: A learned lady? O most rare in kind. And does your husband not misprize this knowledge?
{CONSTANCE}: Oh I'm not married.
{IAGO}: [Aside] Most unnatural!
{OTHELLO}: A virgin oracle! Thanks be to Dian!
{DESDEMONA}: Brave aged maid, to wander all alone!
{CONSTANCE}: I'm really more of an armchair traveller. In fact this is the biggest trip I've made. I've only ever gone on package tours.
{DESDEMONA}: I long to hear the story of your life.
{CONSTANCE}: There isn't much to tell. It's very dull. I'm certain your life's much much more exciting.
{DESDEMONA}: This modesty becomes your royal self. Othello, may she lodge with us awhile?
{OTHELLO}: I would she'd never leave these bristling banks. She hath uncanny knowledge of our lives, and sees us better than we see ourselves. [To CONSTANCE] So now art thou my oracle and chaste. [OTHELLO grips CONSTANCE in a bear hug] [To DESDEMONA] Hither sent by fortune, she hath saved me from *perdition such as nothing else could match. Make her a darling like your precious eye.* [Aside to CONSTANCE] You are her greatest friend. But don't tell why. [Aside to IAGO] Deliver up the handkerchief, thou cur. [OTHELLO takes the handkerchief and presents it to DESDEMONA]
{IAGO}: [Aside to OTHELLO] I was just testing you my lord. [Exit OTHELLO and IAGO]
{DESDEMONA}: *If I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it to the last article.* Othello's honour is my own. If you do find me foul in this, then let thy sentence fall upon my life; as I am brave Othello's faithful wife. [DESDEMONA seizes CONSTANCE and squeezes her in a soldierly embrace]
{CONSTANCE}: Thanks. [A blast of trumpets] Ah-h!
{DESDEMONA}: Ah, supper. They have killed a suckling pig in honour of thee.
{CONSTANCE}: I'm a vegetarian. That is — I don't eat ... flesh. Of any kind.
{DESDEMONA}: Such abstinence is meet in vestal vows, therefore in all points do I find thee true. I'd serve thee, Pedant! Beg of me a boon! Though it be *full of poise and difficult weight, and fearful to be granted*, I'll perform it!
{CONSTANCE}: There is a problem you could help me with. I'm not sure how to say this.
{DESDEMONA}: Speak it plain.
{CONSTANCE}: All right, I will. I'm from another world—
{DESDEMONA}: Ay, Academe. And ruled by mighty Queens, a race of Amazons who brook no men. 
{CONSTANCE}: It's really more like —
{DESDEMONA}: Nothing if not war-like! I'd join these ranks of spiked and fighting shes: to camp upon the deserts vast and sing our songs of conquest, and a dirge or two for sisters slain on honour's gory field.
{CONSTANCE}: If only I could bring you home with me.
{DESDEMONA}: I'll anywhere with thee, my friend. 
{CONSTANCE}: That's it, you see, I can't return until — That is … my Queens have charged me with a fearful task: I must find out my true identity, and then discover who the author be.
{DESDEMONA}: Thou dost not know thyself?
{CONSTANCE}: Apparently not.
{DESDEMONA}: Do none in Academe know who thou art?
{CONSTANCE}: Maybe. They call me Connie to my face, and something else behind my back.
{DESDEMONA}: What's that? 
{CONSTANCE}: "The Mouse."
{DESDEMONA}: "The Mouse"?
{CONSTANCE}: I saw it carved into a lecture stand.
{DESDEMONA}: The sculptor dies.
{CONSTANCE}: Ironic really, since in my world, women are supposed to be afraid of mice.
{DESDEMONA}: O fie, that's base! Where be the Amazons?
{CONSTANCE}: In fact they're few and far between and often shoved to th' fringe.
{DESDEMONA}: Let's fly to their beleaguered side.
{CONSTANCE}: My tasks. 
{DESDEMONA}: The first task is performed already Con, thou art an Amazon.
{CONSTANCE}: I'm not so sure.
{DESDEMONA}: As to the second task, the Author find. There be no authors here, but warriors.
{CONSTANCE}: I'm looking for the Author of it all. How can I put this? Who made you?
{DESDEMONA}: God made me.
{CONSTANCE}: But do you know another name for God?
{DESDEMONA}: God's secret name?
{CONSTANCE}: That's it! God's secret name.
{DESDEMONA}: Seek not to know what God would keep a mystery.
{CONSTANCE}: Have you known God to be called Shakespeare?
{DESDEMONA}: Shake Spear? He might be a pagan god of war.
{CONSTANCE}: This isn't Shakespeare. It must be a source. Then I was right about the Manuscript!
{DESDEMONA}: Manuscript?
{CONSTANCE}: The book that conjured ... this. It's written by that secret name of God. If I could find those foolscap pages — 
{DESDEMONA}: Fool's cap?
{CONSTANCE}: About yea long, and written in a code; they fell into the garbage. So did I.
{DESDEMONA}: This Garbage, be it ocean, lake or sea?
{CONSTANCE}: ... A sea then — if you like — Sargasso Sea.
{DESDEMONA}: I'll call this quest mine own, my constant friend. Though I should drown in deep Sargasso Sea, I'll find thine unknown Author and Fool's Cap, *for I do love thee! And when I love thee not, chaos is come again.* [A cannon blast. CONSTANCE is badly startled. Battle cries within] 
The infidel! This volley heralds battle with the Turk. Let's to the sea wall and enjoy the fray!
{CONSTANCE}: Oh no, I can't. I can't stand violence.
{DESDEMONA}: If thou wouldst know thyself an Amazon, acquire a taste for blood. I'll help thee. Come. [She takes CONSTANCE 'S hand and starts to lead her of. CONSTANCE pulls back.]
{CONSTANCE}: No, please!!! I won't look. I'll be sick. I can't even kill a mosquito!
{DESDEMONA}: Thou shalt be et alive in Cyprus, Con. Learn to kill.
{CONSTANCE}: No!
{DESDEMONA}: *That’s a fault!* Thy sole deficiency. An errant woman that would live alone, no husband there, her honour to defend, must study to be bloody and betimes.
{CONSTANCE}: Please promise me you'll follow your advice.
{DESDEMONA}: So will we both. And we be women; not mice. Come go with me. 
{CONSTANCE}: Okay, I'll be right there. 
[DESDEMONA exits] They can't use real blood, can they? [Another cannon blast] 
Omigod! Oh Constance, don't be scared, it's just a play, and Desdcmona will look after you. Desdemona! I am verging on the greatest academic breakthrough of the twentieth century! I merely must determine authorship. But have I permanently changed the text? — You're floundering in the waters of a flood; the Mona Lisa and a babe float by. Which one of these two treasures do you save? I've saved the baby, and let the Mona drown — Or did the Author know that I'd be coming here, and leave a part for me to play? How am I cast? As cast-away to start, but what's my role? I entered, deus ex machina, and Desdemona will not die, because I dropped in from the sky ... Does that make this a comedy? And does it prove my thesis true? In that case, I've preempted the Wise Fool! He must be here somewhere — I'll track him down and reinstate him in the text, and then I'll know who wrote this travesty, since every scholar worth her salt agrees, the Fool is the mouthpiece of the Author! It's all so strange ... What's even stranger though —[She counts the beats of her speech by tapping each of the five fingers of one hand onto the palm of the other, in time with her words] I speak in blank verse like the characters: unrhymed iambical pentameter. It seems to come quite nat'rally to me. I feel so eloquent and . . . [Making up the missing beats] eloquent. My god. Perhaps I'm on an acid trip. What if some heartless student spiked my beer?! [Stops counting] Nonsense. This is my head, this is my pen, this is Othello, Act III, Scene iii. [Sounds of the fray within]
{DESDEMONA}: [Within] Constance, the fray!
{CONSTANCE}: Desdemon, I obey! [CONSTANCE dashes off toward DESDEMONA'S yoke] 

$Act 2 Scene 2
{IAGO}: Othello seeks to hide the grisly news that he did almost kill his guiltless wife, so dares not gut me openly in law, but decorates my service with a mean and stinking yoke. For this, I thank the pedant: Othello's vestal mascot, Desdemona's cherished pet. [Takes a Manuscript page from his shirt] My wife found this by chance. It's in no Christian hand, but pigeon pecks — the script of infidels! Or mayhap not. Whate'er it be, I will endow it ill, for it must dovetail with my plot. Let's see: To 'venge myself upon the bookish mouse, regain my former credit with my lord, and undo Desdemona once again . . . How? How? Ah-ha! Confide myself betrayed by pedant's lies, to Desdemona!; for she is of afree and noble nature that thinks men honest that but seem to be. I'll tell her Constance is a spy and whore would skewer state and marriage on the same cabob! Thus I blind and train my falcon for the job. [Enter CONSTANCE]
{DESDEMONA}: Constance! Sister! Here's thy boon! Behold what I have plucked off the beach! [CONSTANCE beholds the head and nearly vomits] 'Tis like to be thy fool's cap. Take it. Read. [CONSTANCE, trying not to make eye contact with the head, plucks the scroll from between its teeth. She opens it. A bowel falls out. She forces herself to read the scroll]
{CONSTANCE}: Hm . it's in Sumerian…
{DESDEMONA}: Script of infidels!
{CONSTANCE}: [Reads] "The tapestries and portraits of the main hall. Five spring lambs, all the horse and woman-flesh ..." This isn't it. This is a looting list.
{DESDEMONA}: [Addressing head] Villain! [Tosses head off] [CONSTANCE IS about to faint] Faint not my noble heart of Academe. Envision thy worst foe with open gorge.
{CONSTANCE}: But I don't have a foe.
{DESDEMONA}: Fie, thou must have!
{CONSTANCE}: There's only one on earth whom I resent. But never did he mean to hurt me. 
{DESDEMONA}: Nay? Who be this false foe?
{CONSTANCE}: He's Professor Claude Night. 
{DESDEMONA}: What harm to thee? 
{CONSTANCE}: I used to work for him. For ten years I ... assisted him, by writing. Some articles he would have writ himself, had he the time, but he's a busy man. Now he's got tenure and an Oxford post I hoped was meant for me.
{DESDEMONA}: Ten years of ghostly writing for a thief? Thy mind hath proved a cornucopia to slake the glutton, sloth, and he hath cooked his stolen feast on thy Promethean heat.
{CONSTANCE}: You really think so?
{DESDEMONA}: Ay! Thou wast in thrall; ten years an inky slave in paper chains!
{CONSTANCE}:Yeah.
{DESDEMONA}: He wears the laurel wreath that should be thine.
{CONSTANCE}: I guess he does.
{DESDEMONA}: And commands the legion Academe from Lecture Stands that he usurped from thee.
{CONSTANCE}: What can you do?
{DESDEMONA}: Gird thou thy trembling loins, and slay Professor Night!
{CONSTANCE}: I'm guilty too: I helped him in deceiving Queen's for years.
{IAGO}: [Aside] This will serve my turn upon the pedant. [Exit IAGO]
{DESDEMONA}: Thine eyes were shrouded by the demon Night, and so art thou more sinned against than sinning.
{CONSTANCE}: Thanks.
{DESDEMONA}: But tell me more of life in Academe. If there be cannibals that each other eat, and men whose hues do grow beneath their shoulders? These things to hear, I seriously incline.
{CONSTANCE}: It is quite dog eat dog. And scary too. I've slaved for years to get my doctorate, but in a field like mine that's so well trod, you run the risk of contradicting men who've risen to the rank of sacred cow, and dying on the horns of those who rule the pasture with an iron cud. Not that I'm some kind of feminist. I shave my legs and I get nervous in a crowd — it's just that . . . I was labelled as a crackpot, by the sacred herd of Academe; and after years spent as a laughingstock, I finally came to think that it was true. But, Desdemona, now that I've met you, I want to stand out in that field and cry, "Bullshit!"
{DESDEMONA}: Wherefore? And what, pray tell, may bullshit be?
{CONSTANCE}: A kind of lie. For instance, Academe believes that you're a doomed and helpless victim.
{DESDEMONA}: I?
{CONSTANCE}: Ay.
{DESDEMONA}: Did I not beat a path into the fray, my vow to honour in thy fool's cap quest? Did I not flee my father, here to dwell beneath the sword Hephaestus forged for Mars? Will I not dive into Sargasso Sea, to serve abreast the Amazons abroad? Will I not butcher any cow that dares low lies to call me tame, ay that I will! So raise I now the battle cry, Bullshit!!
{CONSTANCE & DESDEMONA}: Bullshit!!! Bullshit!!! Bullshit!!!
{CONSTANCE}: You are magnificent! Othello should make you his lieutenant. You're capable of greatness, Desdemona. [Enter the SOLDIER]
{SOLDIER}: What ho! What ho! What ho! What ho! What ho! Othello, warrior and raconteur, would see my lady pedant post-post-haste, in discourse touching secrets of the state.
{CONSTANCE}: Oh, okay. Bye.
{DESDEMONA}: Commend me to my lord. [IAGO enters as CONSTANCE and the SOLDIER exit. He sneaks up behind DESDEMONA with his bucket. She sniffs the air] What putrefaction haunts the island air? Belike the slaughtered entrails of our meal?
{IAGO}: My lady.
{DESDEMONA}: O Iago! And so low?
{IAGO}: But that the love I bear my lord forbids, I'd howl of treachery that tumbled me from officer, to sweeper of his sewers.
{DESDEMONA}: Nay, speak. 
{IAGO}: Since you command it, ma'am, I will: Once prowled I o'er the battlements, a proud protective beast to prey upon my lord's fell foes. Now creep I fetid conduits, to paw the slime, a declawed panther, trapped. And by a cunning mouse.
{DESDEMONA}: What rodent, this?
{IAGO}: Was that the Academic with you now?
{DESDEMONA}: It was.
{IAGO}: And called in private haste unto my Lord?
{DESDEMONA}: He makes of her his Delphic prophetess. Othello said she knows our secret selves.
{IAGO}: Indeed?
{DESDEMONA}: Indeed? Ay, indeed. Discernst thou aught in that? Is she not honest?
{IAGO}: Honest, madam?
{DESDEMONA}: Honest? Ay, honest.
{IAGO}: For aught I know.
{DESDEMONA}: What dost thou think?
{IAGO}: Think, my lady?
{DESDEMONA}: Think my lady? By heaven, thou echo 'st me. Thou dost mean something. If thou dost love me, show me thy thought.
{IAGO}: It were not for your quiet nor your good, to let you know my thoughts.
{DESDEMONA}: By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts!
{IAGO}: Beware my lady, of the mouse who eats the lion’s cheese while sitting in his lap.
{DESDEMONA}: …cheese? …mouse? — lion? — in his lap? … to eat there? — What?! Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy?
{IAGO}: I would I did suspect more harlotry.
{DESDEMONA}: Go to, thou knave! [DESDEMONA goes to strike IAGO]
{IAGO}: O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world, to be direct and honest is not safe. [He goes to exit]
{DESDEMONA}: Nay stay. Thou shouldst be honest.
{IAGO}: I obey.
{DESDEMONA}: And give the worst of thoughts the worst of words. 
{IAGO}: She lacks a husband.
{DESDEMONA}: So? ‘Tis vestal study that anoints her chaste.
{IAGO}: Pray God she be not secretly married.
{DESDEMONA}: What dost thou mean?
{IAGO}: A hag may seem a maid, when she in truth is Satan’s bride.
{DESDEMONA}: A witch?
{IAGO}: She hath uncanny knowledge of our lives.
{DESDEMONA}: She spake of conjuring. And names for God, unknown to Christian ears. Of Amazons, who brook no men and live alone. Of mice —
{IAGO}: — her own familiar spirits.
{DESDEMONA}: Of men, that she changed into sacred cows.
{IAGO}: And so did Circe turn Ulysses' friends to pigs by witchcraft after she had lain with them.
{DESDEMONA}: She's with Othello now; ye stars forfend, he be not changed by suppertime! I'll hence!
{IAGO}: Stay ma'am! That is but half her purpose here. Doth not the pedant prate of fool's cap?
{DESDEMONA}: It is a boon, that I am honour-bound to find. I swore upon my life, this to perform.
{IAGO}: The devil thus recruits an honest heart. What's writ upon the fool's cap, in what tongue?
{DESDEMONA}: A foreign tongue that's known to her alone.
{IAGO}: What if it be an incantation, wrought by infidels?
{DESDEMONA}: I saw her read their script. if it be that -
{IAGO}: If it be that, or any heathen tongue, it speaks against her with the other proofs.
{DESDEMONA}: Is she an evil witch they have employed to conjure up our secrets to their ears?!
{IAGO}: The Turk did strike the hour she arrived.
{DESDEMONA}: O that the slave had forty thousand lives. One is too poor, too weak for my revenge! O why did I embrace her as my friend?! 'Tis monstrous, O!!
{IAGO}: I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.
{DESDEMONA}: Nat a jot. I'll to my lord and dilate all.
{IAGO}: Hold! My lord's bewitched and hates me now; he'll not believe.
{DESDEMONA}: Then how should we proceed? 
{IAGO}: Be not forsworn. Fulfill thy boon to her: recover her unholy foolish cap, her guilt to prove before you strike.
{DESDEMONA}: And proving guilt, I'll spit her head upon a pike for daws to peck at. Thou wilt instruct me in the manly work of sword-play; doubtless she is expert there, for all her lack-a-liver timid show!
{IAGO}: Patience, I say. Your mind may change.
{DESDEMONA}: As well it may. La donna é mobile.
{IAGO}: [Alarmed] Yet watch her ma'am, if thou hast eyes to see. She did deceive her Queens; and she may thee. [CONSTANCE and OTHELLO enter in conversation, unaware of DESDEMONA and IAGO who draw back to listen, observe and comment aside]
{OTHELLO}: As thou dost love me, not a word of this to Desdemona. She must not suspect.
{CONSTANCE}: Don't worry, it will be our little secret. [They chuckle. DESDEMONA lunges forward but IAGO pulls her back]
{DESDEMONA}: Look how she laughs already [OTHELLO takes out a large version of the velvet box that Professor Night had in Act I, Scene i]
{OTHELLO}: Which jewels most delight your female eye?
{CONSTANCE}: Diamonds, of course; a girl's best friend. [OTHELLO opens the box, takes out a diamond necklace with a prominent gold clasp and places it around CONSTANCE 's neck]
{DESDEMONA}: Festoons the whore with baubles!
{OTHELLO}: The bees of Solomon ne'er counselled half so wise. Unto thy sweet and hiving breast, do I confide the honey of my heart.
{DESDEMONA}: Drone on my husband, drone.
{CONSTANCE}: Don't mention it.
{OTHELLO}: Have I e'er told thee of the time I slew a singing beast in Turkish Antioch? 'Twas on a grassy river bank where grazed a golden ox. The beast did tend this ox. Three heads grew from the shoulders of the beast. On one the hair was black as ebony, the other crown was curled angel fair, the third head wore a scarlet cap of wool, that ended in a foolish bauble bright. I asked the beast to show the shallow spot where it was wont to ford the ox of gold.
{CONSTANCE}: In some strange way this beast seems so familiar.
{IAGO}: "Familiar"! Yet again "familiar"! Most potent witch to suckle such a beast!
{CONSTANCE}: You say you killed it dead?
{OTHELLO}: The demon fell and bled a sea of inky green.
{CONSTANCE}: Alas.
{DESDEMONA}: She mourns a beast of Turkish Antioch!
{OTHELLO}: I left the thing for dead, as I made haste to find a shallow spot and ford my ox.
{CONSTANCE}: Your ox? Ford, your ox? [Aside] I'm having deja-vu. I think we'd better leave each other now. Your wife may come and think that something's up. 
{IAGO}: We know what's up, and who will soon go down.
{DESDEMONA}: Adultress! Let me stone her in the square!
{OTHELLO}: Adieu friend, I'll have more of thee anon. [OTHELLO embraces CONSTANCE Vigorously]
{IAGO}: As prime as goats, as hot as monkeys. [OTHELLO releases CONSTANCE and goes to exit. He stops, sniffs the air]
{OTHELLO}: lago?
{IAGO}: [Emerging from the shadows] My lord.
{OTHELLO}: Look to the morning's night-soil. And keep in the light.
{IAGO}: Yes my lord. [OTHELLO pats CONSTANCE on the head]
{CONSTANCE}: [To OTHELLO] 'Night 'night. [As OTHELLO exits, CONSTANCE sees IAGO whisper to DESDEMONA before he too exits. CONSTANCE conceals the necklace]
{DESDEMONA}: Academic!
{CONSTANCE}: Oh, Desdemona — hi. I've been meaning to ask you, does Lord Othello keep a Wise Fool here?
{DESDEMONA}: The only wise fool is a one that's dead. I hate a tripping, singing, licensed fool, that makes a motley of the mighty, and profanes the sacred with base parody.
{CONSTANCE}: Oh. [DESDEMONA glowers at CONSTANCE] Are you okay?
{DESDEMONA}: I have a pain upon my forehead,, here.
{CONSTANCE}: Tsk, tsk, tsk, well I'm not surprised. I saw you talking to that creep, Iago —
{DESDEMONA}: "Creep"?
{CONSTANCE}: Colloquial for, "base and noisome knave." I'd stay away from him if I were you.
{DESDEMONA}: Wherefore? Hast thou some secret knowledge of him?
{CONSTANCE}: Oh yes. You'd be surprised how much I know.
{DESDEMONA}: I think not I think thou know'st my husband.
{CONSTANCE}: I know some things I hope you'll never know.
{DESDEMONA}: What passed between my lord and thee just now?
{CONSTANCE}: Uh-oh. What did you hear?
{DESDEMONA}: Enough to rear suspicion's head.
{CONSTANCE}: Oh no.
{DESDEMONA}: O yes!
{CONSTANCE}: Oh well. Whate'er you do don't let him know that you suspect.
{DESDEMONA}: Nay, he'll know not that I wot aught. (Aside) Goats and monkeys! [DESDEMONA goes to exit] 
{CONSTANCE}: Boy, Shakespeare really watered her down, eh? … I wish I were more like Desdemona. Next to her I'm just a little wimp. A rodent. Road-kill. Furry tragedy all squashed and steaming on the 401 with "Michelin" stamped all over me. It's true: people've always made a fool of me without my even knowing. Gullible. That's me. Old Connie. Good sport. Big joke. Ha. Just like that time at recess in grade five: a gang of bully girls comes up to me. Their arms are linked. they're chanting as they march, "Hey. Hey. Get outta my way! I just got back from the I.G.A.!" I'm terrified. They pin me down, and force me to eat a dog-tongue sandwich. I now know it was only ham … O, what would Desdemona do to Claude, had she the motive and the cue for passion that I have? She would drown all Queen's with blood, and cleave Claude Night's two typing fingers from his guilty hands. She'd wrap them in a box of choc’lates and present them to Ramona. She'd kill him in cold blood and in blank verse, then smear the ivied walls in scarlet letters spelling "thief"! To think, I helped him use me: a gull, a stooge, a swine adorned with mine own pearls, a sous-chef, nay! a scull'ry maid that slaved to heat hell's kitchen with the baking stench of forty-thousand scalding humble-pies, P Vengeance!!! [DESDEMONA and IAGO enter, sword-fighting, DESDEMONA joins with:] Villainy, villainy, villainy! [CONSTANCE disarms IAGO, knocks him down and is poised to skewer him] May thy pernicious soul rot half a grain a day! [She raises her sword to strike, but DESDEMONA stops her]
{DESDEMONA}: Hold! [DESDEMONA helps IAGO to his feet. He glares at CONSTANCE, shaken] 'Twas all in sport.
{CONSTANCE}: Oh.
{IAGO}: Ay.
{CONSTANCE}: Gee. I'm sorry. Um — [to IAGO] here's your sword back and everything. [Retreating] Have fun. [Aside] Dear God, I could have murdered that poor man. l saw a flash of red before my eyes. I felt a rush of power through my veins. I tasted iron blood inside my mouth. I loved it! [CONSTANCE faints]
{DESDEMONA}: If she be false, heaven mocked itself [Holding her sword at IAGO's throat] Wretch, be sure thou prove my friend a villainess! Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof — [IAGO manages to take the Manuscript page from his shirt]
{IAGO}: Yet be content!
{DESDEMONA}: Make me to see’t! [IAGO thrusts the page under her nose] What's this?
{IAGO}: The pedant's fool's cap writ in Turkish code, found by my wife in your underwear drawer! [DESDEMONA releases IAGO]
{DESDEMONA}: Damn her, lewd spy! O damn her, damn her O!
{IAGO}: O, 'tis foul in her.
{DESDEMONA}: And to lie with my husband!
{IAGO}: That's fouler.
{DESDEMONA}: Fool's cap — confession — fool's cap — to confess then die — first to die, then to confess — [DESDEMONA is about to fall prey to apoplexy when CONSTANCE wakes up and picks something off the hem of DESDEMONAS dress]
{CONSTANCE}: My Brownie wings! What are they doing here? I thought I threw them in the garb.... age. Oh.
{DESDEMONA}: [Aside] Sly may be honest yet. I'll try her once in fairness. Then Ill chop her into messes. [DESDEMONA impales the foolscap upon the point of her sword]
{CONSTANCE}: Hey Desdemona! Look what I just found. My Brown Owl wings!
{IAGO}: [Aside to DESDEMONA] An owl stands for a witch! It is the shape that I Hecate takes at night.
{DESDEMONA}: I know who thou art. And I saw what thou didst.
{CONSTANCE}: You mean you've found out who I really am? [DESDEMONA nods] Who?! Who?! Who?!
{IAGO}: The owl's cry! [DESDEMONA points her sword with the foolscap at CONSTANCE’s face]
{DESDEMONA}: Here is the sword of justice. If this be thine, read the verdict and reveal thyself.
{CONSTANCE}: It certainly looks like the real McCoy. [CONSTANCE plucks the foolscap off the sword] It is! Page one! I must be getting warm. (Reads) "Thou'rt cold, and Cyprus is too hot for thee. Seek truth now in Verona, Italy; there find a third to make a trinity, where two plus one adds up to one not three." Hm. How strange. [Warp effect]
{DESDEMONA}: The pedant hath by magic disappeared to fly unto her evil genius, Brown Owl. When she returns with fresh enchantments here, then must the cause of justice claim her life. How shall I kill her Iago? [IAGO hands DESDEMONA the pillow]

$Act 3 Scene  1

{MERCUTIO}: [Draws] Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
{TYBALT}: [Draws] I am for you.
{ROMEO}: Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
{MERCUTIO}: Come sir, your passado!
[They fight. Constance enters in only longjohns no skirt.]
{ROMEO}: Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
[Romeo is about to fatally intervene]
{CONSTANCE}: [Aside] One Mona Lisa down, and one to go. [She tackles ROMEO. They fly into the sword fight, knocking TYBALT and MERCUTIO aside. TYBALT and MERCUTIO jump to their feet and immediately pains their swords at CONSTANCE while ROMEO sits on her]
{MERCUTIO}: Shall I lance the pimple? Or rub the quat to bursting! 
{TYBALT}: Name the house that whelped thee pup! What kennel loosed thee hence to interfere with honour's reck'ning? 
{ROMEO}: [To TYBALT and MERCUTIO] Stay! You fright the wretch. Speak, boy ... speak boy.
{CONSTANCE}: [Aside] Boy? [A moment of decision. She clears her throat to a more masculine pitch]  From Cyprus washed I here ashore, a roving pedant lad to earn my bread by wit and by this fountain pen, my sword. A stranger here, my name is Constan — tine. I couldn't let you kill each other for, young Juliet and Romeo have wed; and by th'untying of their virgin-knot, have tied new blood betwixt you cousins here. Tybalt, Romeo is your cousin now, in law, and so you fellows should shake hands. [A dangerous pause, then TYBALT turns to ROMEO and embraces him] 
{TYBALT}: Cousin Montague!
{ROMEO}: Kindred Capulet! [MERCUTIO and TYBALT embrace CONSTANCE in turn with:]
{TYBALT}: Fortunate harbinger! 
{MERCUTIO}: Madcap youth! 
{ROMEO}: Brave Greek! [ROMEO embraces CONSTANCE, but lingers a little too long; with:] [Aside] Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, nay! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this day!
{MERCUTIO}: Now we have put our angry weapons up, let's hie to Mistress Burnbottom's to put up and to sheath our jocund tools of sport. [Lewd Renaissance gestures and laughter throughout the following dreadful jokes] 
{TYBALT}: A bawd! And falling apart with'th' pox! Take care - She'll pay thee, and with a French crown too! 
{MERCUTIO}: Ay, a bald pate, for a little head! 
{TYBALT}: I'd as lief to pluck a green maid off the street. 
{MERCUTIO}: Thou'dst feel that green fruit yerking in thy guts, when that her kinsfolk 'venged her maidenhead! 
{TYBALT}: She'd never know who'd had her maidenhead, for I would pass as quickly through the wench, as any fruit so green, would pass through me! [Laughter— CONSTANCE bites her thumbnail] Do you bite your thumb at me sir?! 
{CONSTANCE}: No! I just bite my nails, that's all. 
{TYBALT}: Do you bite your nails at me sir?! 
{CONSTANCE}: No I swear! Look, I'll never bite them again. This'll be a great chance for me to quit once and for all. Thanks. [Pause] 
{TYBALT}: You're welcome. 
{ROMEO}: Now t'th' baths, new friendship to baptize! 
{MERCUTIO & TYBALT}: T'th' baths, t'th' baths! 
{ROMEO}: [To CONSTANCE] Come Greekling, splash with us! [ROMEO, TYBALT and MERCUTIO hoist CONSTANCE onto their shoulders] 
{CONSTANCE}: No, wait! I can't! I had a bath today. [Struggling down] What's more, I've got a lot of things to do; I have to buy a lute, a sword, some hose, and teach a class or two before it's noon, in time to see a man about a horse. 
{ROMEO}: I'd see thee mounted well in stallion flesh. Beware thou art deceived not in a mare. [ROMEO, TYBALT and MERCUTIO exit] 
{CONSTANCE}: Thank God they think that I'm a man. [To God] Thank you. O thank you. How long can I avoid their locker room? Those guys remind me of the Stratford shows I've seen, where each production has a Roman bath: the scene might be a conference of state, but steam will rise and billow from the wings, while full-grown men in Velcro loincloths speak, while snapping towels at each other. Why is it Juliet's scenes with her Nurse are never in a sauna. Or King Lear. imagine Goneril and Regan, steaming as they plot the downfall of their Dad, while tearing hot wax from each other's legs; Ophelia, drowning in a whirlpool full of naked women. Portia, pumping iron [A woman screams within. Male laughter] [Verge of tears] I want to go home. I want to see my cats. I want to read Jane Eyre again and never leave the house. Where's the Fool? Where's the damn Fool?! How come I end up doing all his work? I should have waited in the wings for him to leap on stage and stop the fight, and then I could have pinned him down and forced him to reveal the Author's name! The Author — who must know my true identity. The Author! who — I have to pee.. . There must be a convent around here somewhere. [Exit CONSTANCE] 

$Act 3 Scene 2

{JULIET}: Ay me. [Yawn] 
{ROMEO}: [Half-asleep] Was that the lark? 
{JULIET}: It was the luncheon bell. 
{ROMEO}: Oh no! [Leaps out of bed] Julie-e-et, where be my blue doublet?! 
{JULIET}: Under the bed where thou didst leave it, dear. [ROMEO retrieves his doublet] 
{JULIET & ROMEO}: [Both aside] Th'affections of our love's first-sighted blood, have in the cauldron of one hot swift night, all cooled to creeping jelly in the pot. 
{JULIET}: Wilt thou begone? 
{ROMEO}: [On with the doublet] Yes dear. There's some fun going forward at The Gondolier: the fellows and I are getting up a cock-fight, followed by a bear-bait-ing, then hie us to a public hanging in the piazza, there to take our noon-day meal. [Aside] I mean to find the lovely Greek boy, Constantine, or die. 
{JULIET}: Goodbye dear. 
{ROMEO}: Goodbye. [ROMEO exits on the run, but stops short just outside] Zounds! I had forgot. [He heads back into the chamber] What Julie-e-et! 
{JULIET}: What? [ROMEO is frantically searching for something] 
{ROMEO}: Where be Hector, my turtle? 
{JULIET}: Belike dead in the chamber pot. 
{ROMEO}: [Verge of tears] Dead?! My Hector?! 
{JULIET}: [Verge of tears] Dead?! Sayest thou?! 
{ROMEO}: Nay, thou sayest so! 
{JULIET}: Nay, I know not. Perchance he lives yet in the water dish. [ROMEO and JULIET both dash to the water dish and re-trieve Hector the turtle, whom they share between their two cupped hands] 
{ROMEO}: Poseidon be thanked! Hector lives to fight another day! 
{JULIET}: Be Lazarus from this day forth, thou risen turtle. [They shower the turtle with loving kisses] 
{ROMEO}: [To JULIET] I must be gone. [They exchange a cursory peck on the cheek] 
{JULIET}: Goodbye dear. 
{ROMEO}: Goodbye dear. [ROMEO attempts to exit with Hector] Let go thy hand, for I must needs be gone, and Hector goes with me. 
{JULIET}: Nay, stays with me. 
{ROMEO}: He goes. 
{JULIET}: He stays! [A turtle tug-of-war ensues] 
{ROMEO}: Goes! 
{JULIET}: Stays! 
{ROMEO}: Goes! [Hector is ripped in two] 
{JULIET}: Ah! Hector! Look how he bleeds! 
{ROMEO}: Warm and new killed. O Hector. O heavens! [They weep]
{JULIET}: Thou bloody-fingered boy, hast slaughtered him! 
{ROMEO}: Thou panther-taloned girl, hast rent his shell! 
{JULIET}: I'll tell my father! 
{ROMEO}: So will I tell mine! O wherefore did I wive a sniv'lling girl?! [ROMEO exits in tears] 
{JULIET}: O wherefore married I a stripling boy?! [NURSE calls from within] 
{NURSE}: What Juliet, ladybird, what little maid! 
{JULIET}:  [Aside] No maid but matron, thus made and unmade. [NURSE enters. She is hot and puffing, and carries a gift-wrapped package] 
{NURSE}: Another wedding gift for thee my lamb. Beshrew this heat, Verona is ablaze! 'T'will be tomorrow fourteen years ago since thou wert born upon a wave of heat that cooked the country, marry, to an ash. Child look, I have a pretty box for thee. [JULIET doesn't look up] 
{JULIET}: Say if it take the measure of my corpse? 
{NURSE}: Nay, 'tis no bigger than a bread chest. 
{JULIET}: Entomb it with the rest and leave me be, and when thou hast done so, come weep with me, past hope, past care, past help, past tense, O Nurse!!! [JULIET flings herself upon NURSE'S bosom and sobs] 
{NURSE}: There, there, lamb, thou art too soon made a bride. Was Cupid's loving dart too sharp for thee? Say if Romeo's of unnatural size, to tear [As in "tear drop 'J thee so? Or mayhap, saints forfend, behind his boyish drool there lurks a foaming wolf! A pox on him! Though't be thy wifely load, to bear his married weight, I'll pry him hence, with false chancres for thy nether lips.
{JULIET}: Oh Nurse, 'tis none of these! 
{NURSE}: What is it then? 
{JULIET}: I die of tedium! 
{NURSE}: Oh. 
{JULIET}: O Hymen, god of marriage, pray undo thy holy work: Make me a maid again! To plunge once more in love's first fiery pit, to hover there 'twixt longing and content, condemned to everlasting Limbo, O! Penance me with new love's burning tongs; spit and sear me slow o'er heaven's flames; grant me an eternity to play with fire! 
{NURSE}: By my maid'nhead, what a turn is here. 
{JULIET}: O, I have naught to live for from today; a once-plucked rose that withers ere it's blown; tomorrow sees the change of fourteen years, yet even now my life is ended. 
{NURSE}: Nay. There's much to live for yet. 
{JULIET}: Name one of much. 
{NURSE}: This very night thy wedding feast invites Verona to a table that doth groan with joy, and creak at new-fit joinery of married Capulet and Montague. 
{JULIET}: [Subsiding sobs] A party? Tonight? I had forgot. 
{NURSE}: Be merry. Feast thine eyes on fresh gallants; rekindle loving embers to re-heat thy day-old husband when the feast is o'er. 
{JULIET}: I will look. And yet not seek to touch. Thanks Nurse. [Aside] But touched and whetted once before, love's first keen edge grows dull with use and craves another grinding. [To NURSE] Nurse, what shall I wear? 



$Act 3 Scene 3

{CONSTANCE}: I've found him. I've found the Fool. He's skulking around here, carrying a bag full of Manuscript pages. [CONSTANCE lurks apart, as a strangely dressed SERVANT enters with a bag full of foolscap scrolls outwardly identical to the Manuscript pages] [Aside] I suppose I could just ask him . . . no: "When in Verona —" [CONSTANCE pounces on him and pins him down] Name the Author, thou elusive Fool! What fiendish hack is he that scribbled thee and these [Scrolls] and this [This world] unto the light of day?! 
{SERVANT}: Don't hurt me sir, pray hurt me not and I will talk. 
{CONSTANCE}: I'm listening. 
{SERVANT}: My master is the great rich Capulet and he hath writ all that you see. 
{CONSTANCE}: Juliet's father, Capulet? [The SERVANT nods] Wrote all this? [She regards the scrolls] Wow. [CONSTANCE unrolls the scroll and — with great expectation — looks at it. But there is no warp. She riffles the other scrolls.]  These are just party invitations. 
{SERVANT}: Ay. 
{CONSTANCE}: [Reading aloud] "Signor Capulet is pleased to am announce the marriage of his daughter, Juliet, to Romeo of Montague, and doth request the honour of your company at a masked ball this night." You’re not the Fool. 
{SERVANT}: Thank you, sir. 
{CONSTANCE}: [To herself] A masked ball for Romeo ... and Juliet …"a third to make a trinity" ... I’ve got to buy a mask!

$Act 3 Scene 4

{JULIET}: Boy, wherefore is thy voice so sweet and high? 
{SERVANT}: For that I sing castrato, lady. 
{JULIET}: Oh. Hast thou a brother that's a tenor? 
{SERVANT}: Ay ma'am. [Points off]  Look where he tunes his instrument. 
{JULIET}: [Exiting] So tune I mine, to pitch in sweet duet. 
{ROMEO}: If only Constantine were here tonight; this feast were better borne in light of him. I feigned a mirthful splashing at the baths, and sought, but could not find him out today. What if he's gone and barked again for Greece? If this be so, I'll to my closet straight, there to forswear all daylight and all food, to mirror thus the wasting of my heart, all shrouded in the dark night of my soul. [Enter TYBALT, masked. ROMEO approaches him from behind] [Aside] No mask can hide that sleek Aegean form. This is my Constant-teen as I am his. [ROMEO places his hand on TYBALT’S bottom. TYBALT whirls about, yanks ROMEO'S eye mask forward, and lets it snap back when he recognizes him] 
{TYBALT}: Ah, Romeo, 'tis thee my cuz! [TYBALT gives ROMEO a macho slap on the ass and laughs] 
{ROMEO}: Tybalt! I knew 'twas thee. [ROMEO punches TYBALT , jock-like, on the arm. The friendly brutality goes on until ROMEO sees CONSTANCE enter, wearing a stupid Mouse half-mask.] I'll pummel thee to pulp anon, my cuz, but now must I put on the gentle host. [ROMEO leaves TYBALT and cautiously approaches CONSTANCE. TYBALT exits.] Constantine? 
{CONSTANCE}: Romeo? 
{ROMEO}: Ay! 
{CONSTANCE}: Hi. [ROMEO embraces CONSTANCE warmly, taking her off guard] Oh. [Extricating herself] Heh. [ROMEO gazes into her eyes] Um. How do you like being married?
{ROMEO}: Speak not of Juliet, 'tis thee I love. 
{CONSTANCE}: What? [Romeo drops to one knee and seizes her hand] 
{ROMEO}: O Constantine, O emperor of my heart! It is my sex that is thine enemy. Call me but love, and I’ll be new endowed. 
{CONSTANCE}: It isn't that — good grief, get up. 
{ROMEO}: Then love me! [He jumps up to kiss her. CONSTANCE escapes] 
{CONSTANCE}: No, please, I — I'm not that kind of boy. 
{ROMEO}: What kind of boy? 
{CONSTANCE}: The kind that can just hop right into bed with any Tom or Dick or . . . Romeo
{ROMEO}: Where be these rivals, Tom and Dick?! Are their sweet lips more to thy taste than mine? 
{CONSTANCE}:  Oh no, I… suspect that you're beyond compare. 
{ROMEO}: Then kiss me now and prove suspicion true. Surrender unto Romeo thy lips, and let him enter at those ruby gates, forever barred against both Tom and Dick. 
{CONSTANCE}: [About to yield] Oh my. [Enter TYBALT, jovial, drinking a Coors Light] 
{TYBALT}: [Aside] I'm told the Greek boy, Constantine, doth feast with us tonight. [Sees CONSTANCE] Ah. [ROMEO kisses CONSTANCE 's neck] [Aside] O! What, an Hellenic deviant?! O fie! 
{CONSTANCE}: Please, Romeo, you don't understand, I can't do this, I'm not — I'm — way too old for you! 
{ROMEO}: A maiden blush bepaints thy hairless cheek. [He strokes her check] Eternal springs the fountain of thy youth; I'd quench myself at thy Priapic font. [He kisses her neck]
{CONSTANCE}: O . . . Romeo… 
{TYBALT}: [Aside] And dares this mockery of manhood bent, come hither, covered with an antic face, to fleer and lisp at our solemnity? 
{CONSTANCE}: Romeo, please, I know your family — they'll be very upset. 
{ROMEO}: Boy, what love can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore my kinsmen are no stop to me. 
{CONSTANCE}: They are to me! I'm not a hero, I'm just a school teacher. 
{ROMEO}: And my Socrates that art condemned in sweet subversion of Verona's youth. Then die thou not alone. I’ll kiss thy lips. Haply some hemlock yet doth hang on them.
{CONSTANCE}: I don't want to die! 
{ROMEO}: O that I were a fountain pen within thy hand, to spurt forth streams of eloquence at thy command! [ROMEO kisses CONSTANCE. She yields] 
{TYBALT}:  [Aside] The villain! He is hither come in spite, to shame my cousin, Romeo, this night. [Enter JULIET, dishevelled. TYBALT hides his rage. the kiss ends] [To JULIET] Gentle cuz, pray rescue Romeo; he's trapped in tedious discourse with that man. 
{JULIET}: Romeo, a messenger doth cry. 
{ROMEO}: Perchance he cries for thee, dear. 
{CONSTANCE}: [Awestruck] Juliet? 
{JULIET}: Ay. 
{ROMEO}: Juliet, this be Constantine, the Greek blind Cupid's servant, who unveiled our love for all the world to see. 
{JULIET}: Oh. Thanks. [Aside] The Greek hath taught not just the world to see, but also me. Would I were blind again. [CONSTANCE removes her mask and extends her hand]
{CONSTANCE}: I'm truly thrilled to meet you, Juliet. 
{JULIET}: [Aside] Hail, Roman Cupid that hath heard my cries, and sent Greek Eros to benight mine eyes! [JULIET takes CONSTANCE'S hand and does not release it] [To ROMEO] Romeo, a man doth steal thy horse within. [Exit ROMEO, alarmed. Music. JULIET leads CONSTANCE in a dance throughout the following dialogue] Romeo spake of thee as pedant wise. 
{CONSTANCE}: I wouldn't say I'm really all that wise. I have done lots of homework on you, though. For years I've sought to penetrate your source, and dreamt of meeting you a thousand times -
{JULIET}: Awake. Or let me share thy sleep of dreams. I'd have thee penetrate my secret source, and know me full as well and deep as thou dost know thyself O dreamer, Constantine.
{CONSTANCE}: There must be something in Verona's air; I feel like half my years have dropped away. 
{JULIET}: The air is redolent with hearts afire; their flames all licking at thy new-blown lip, consume thy tongue to spark of love alone. 
{CONSTANCE}: Wow. [JULIET gives a little laugh. CONSTANCE giggles] May I ask you something? 
{JULIET}: Anything. 
{CONSTANCE}: You're the essence of first love — of beauty that will never fade, of passion that will never die. Are you afraid of growing old? 
{JULIET}: No one may remain forever young. We change our swaddling clothes for funeral shrouds, and in between is one brief shining space, where love may strike by chance, but only death is sure. 
{CONSTANCE}: What happens though, if love itself should die? 
{JULIET}: When love goes to its grave before we do, then find another love for whom to die, and swear to end life first when next we love. [Enter TYBALT and ROMEO from different places]
{ROMEO}: [Aside] I rode not hither on a horse tonight! 
{TYBALT}: [Aside re CONSTANCE] O villain, that would plunder shirt and skirt! 
{ROMEO}: [Aside re CONSTANCE] How swingst thou now, capricious pendulum! 
{TYBALT}: [Aside re CONSTANCE] Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, to strike him dead, I hold it not a sin. 
{ROMEO}: [Aside] Then let a bodice be my winding sheet; I'll wear a woman's gown until I die, sith it's a piece of skirt that likes his eye! [JULIET and CONSTANCE dance by. ROMEO cuts in and continues the dance with CONSTANCE] 
{JULIET}: [Aside] I now perceive the slant of Constantine’s desire. He looks to match his stick to light his fire. And since he savours a two legged pose, I'll into Romeo's closet and steal hose!
{TYBALT}: [Aside] I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall, now seeming sweet, convert to bittrest gall. [TYBALT crushes his Coors Light can in his fist, tosses it at CONSTANCE’S feet, and exits. CONSTANCE pauses in her dance with ROMEO, picks up the can, and recognizes it] 
{JULIET}: [Aside] Thou pretty boy, I will ungreek thee yet [Intercepting CONSTANCE] If I profane with my unworthiest hand—
{ROMEO}: Hold! I saw him first. 
{JULIET}: Thou wouldst corrupt him. 
{ROMEO}: Sayst thou?! Thou that bedded the first doublet to o'erperch thine orchard walls?
{JULIET}: Thou caitiff! I sicken of thy blubb'ring boyish charm. 
{ROMEO}: Thou'rt in the green-eyed clutch of envy, sweet. 
{JULIET}: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may," Romeo, for with each new lust, thou creepeth close unto the aged day when soft moist lip and dewy eye convert to senile rheum. 
{ROMEO}: Thinkst thou to leave a lovely corpse my dear, when even now the crows have footed it in merry measure all about thine eyes? 
{JULIET}: Oh! I shall tell my father of this insult! [They are both on the verge of passionate tears]
{ROMEO}: Be thou assured my father will hear of it! 
{CONSTANCE}: You kids, now that's enough, just settle down, involving family here will make things worse. 
{JULIET}: [Weeping] I wish I were dead! 
{ROMEO}: [Weeping] I wish I had ne'er been born! 
{CONSTANCE}: Now, that's no way to talk. Apologize, and count your lucky stars. [ROMEO and JULIET stare at CONSTANCE for a moment] 
{ROMEO & JULIET}:  [To CONSTANCE] Our lucky stars? 
{CONSTANCE}: I need a breath of air. Thanks for the party. It was a ball. Shut up Constance. [Exit CONSTANCE]

$Act 3 Scene 5

{JULIET}: [Below] But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the East, and Constantine the sun!
{CONSTANCE}: Uh oh.
{JULIET}: He speaks. 
{CONSTANCE}: Romeo? Is that you 
{JULIET}: l know not how to tell thee who I am. My sex, dear boy, is hateful to myself because it is an enemy to thee; therefore I wear tonight, this boyish hose. 
{CONSTANCE}: Juliet? What are you doing down there? How on earth did you get into the orchard? 
{JULIET}: With love's light wings did I o’erperch – 
{CONSTANCE}: I see. I'm sorry Juliet, it's not to be, I'm not at all the man you think I am.
{JULIET}: I wot well what thou art, and yet I love. 
{CONSTANCE}: You do? 
{JULIET}: Ay. 
{CONSTANCE}: You mean you know my true identity? 
{JULIET}: Indeed. Thou art a deviant of Greece. O Constantine! O wherefore art thou bent?
{CONSTANCE}: Shshshsh! Good heavens, keep your voice down please. 
{JULIET}: Deny thy preference and refuse thy sex; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, and henceforth never will I be a girl. 
{CONSTANCE}: I'm not . . . a deviant, for heaven's sake.
{JULIET}: Not deviant? Art thou then a timid virgin? Dear boy, I envy thee thy bliss to come.
{CONSTANCE}: I may be celibate, but I'm not exactly a virgin. 
{JULIET}: Tut, boyish bluster. Hast thou tasted woman? 
{CONSTANCE}: No! 
{JULIET}: Then are thy vestal senses all intact. O let Juliet initiate thy budding taste of woman's dewy rose. Learn how the rose becomes a sea of love: come part the waves and plumb Atlantic depths. I'll guide thee to the oyster's precious pearl ... we'll seek out wat'ry caves for glist'ning treasure, spelunk all night until we die of pleasure. 
{CONSTANCE}: I'm not into that sort of thing. 
{JULIET}: Then claim another conduit for thy use. 
{CONSTANCE}: Heavenly days, what's come over you?! You're supposed to be all innocence.
{JULIET}: The time for innocence is sped! I'll love once more before I'm dead! 
{CONSTANCE}: Who said anything about dying? You're only fourteen years old. 
{JULIET}: Thirteen! Tomorrow will I be fourteen. 
{CONSTANCE}: You will? So will I! I mean, be a year older. 
{JULIET}: We share the self-same stars! We're truly matched. 
{CONSTANCE}: Juliet? 
{JULIET}: My love? 
{CONSTANCE}: I'm flattered. And you're very beautiful, and sweet and passionate, and probably a — lovely ... lover, but — in point of fact, I don't — I can't — I must — not. Love you. Juliet. 
{JULIET}: Wherefore? 
{CONSTANCE}: Well ... for one thing, you're married. 
{JULIET}: Hmph. 
{CONSTANCE}: And we've barely met. 
{JULIET}: So? 
{CONSTANCE}: I don't believe in love-at-first-sight. 
{JULIET}: Say then that thou dost not believe in air! Or in the solid ground on which we tread! Nay, love's a force of nature, can’t be stopped; the lightning waiteth not upon my thought to thus endow it bright; it doth but light! 
{CONSTANCE}: Nay, love's a bond of servitude; a trap that sly deceptors lay for fools – fools they use then throw away, or trade in like a lib'ry book they've read, then lost, then found beneath the bed all coffee-stained and dust-bunnied, all dog-eared, thumbed and overdue.
{JULIET}: Thou art one that loved and lost.
{CONSTANCE}: Well. I will admit I had a crush —delayed post-adolescent fantasy. 
{JULIET}: Seek not to excuse thy one true love. 
{CONSTANCE}: No. I refuse to say that I felt love for someone who did grind my mind to pulp, and lined a gilded bird-cage with the dust. He played the parrot: I fed him great lines, and he pooped on my head. 
{JULIET}: Unrequited love. 
{CONSTANCE}: It certainly was unrequited: I never pooped back. I could kick myself. 
{JULIET}: He crushed thy heart as 't'were a pomegranate underfoot and thou didst kiss that foot.
{CONSTANCE}: (Starting to give in] Yes. 
{JULIET}: And doted on his every whim. 
{CONSTANCE}: Yes. 
{JULIET}: And idolized him from the start. 
{CONSTANCE}: I loved him from the moment I first saw him across the crowded cafeteria. He looked so dignified, and irritated. I stood second in the line for lunch. I saw him check his watch and pinch his nose. "He has important things to do," I thought, and so I offered up my place to him. He thanked me in his cultivated voice, and asked where one might find a decent cup of tea. I told him I'd be glad to make him one, and shared with him the last of my Velvecta. He smiled as he ate my cheese. I loved that man ... 
{JULIET}: Tell heaven! 
{CONSTANCE}: [Meekly to heaven] I loved Claude Night. Love. 
{JULIET}: Declaim! 
{CONSTANCE}: Love. Love! I love that shit, Claude Night! Amour — at-first-sight, in plain view, a coup de foudre, la vie en soir, amo, amas, amat!!! There. I've said it. So what do I do now?
{JULIET}: Impale thy cleaved heart upon a sword! 
{CONSTANCE}: Yes O yes!!! I wish I had the nerve to do it right in front of everyone while standing in the cafeteria line!; to play a swan-song on my arteries, anoint the daily special with my veins! 
{JULIET}: [Offering dagger] Stab thyself first, then will I stab mine! 
{CONSTANCE}: Thanks. That's very sweet of you, Juliet. But not just now. I have to find the Author first; or else the Fool to lead me to the bard. 
{JULIET}: Author? Fool? 
{CONSTANCE}: And Self. It is my quest, and it means more to me than love or death. 
{JULIET}: What passion is of such ferocity? 
{CONSTANCE}: The one that killed the cat: curiosity. 
{JULIET}: I know the Author, Constantine. 
{CONSTANCE}: You do? 
{JULIET}: Ay. The Fool told me. 
{CONSTANCE}: Who is he? What's his name? 
{JULIET}: Wouldst love me if I told thee who it be? 
{CONSTANCE}: Until I pass into another world.
{JULIET}: Mount unto my closet for a tryst. I'll trade the name, and claim of thee one kiss.
{CONSTANCE}: Okay. [JULIET goes to exit] Hey, wait up! 
{JULIET}: I dare not risk discovery in thy company; we must go severally. Dost thou espy yon boneyard? 
{CONSTANCE}: Yes, I see it. 
{JULIET}: My balcony lies three courtyards to the east of that unhallowed ground. 
{CONSTANCE}: Why is it unhallowed? 
{JULIET}: For that the bones of actors, whores and pedants lie there buried and condemned. [JULIET blows a kiss and exits] 
{CONSTANCE}: Thanks. [Exit CONSTANCE. Enter ROMEO, furtive, in Juliet's clothing]
{ROMEO}: [Aside] I dare not take the front gate for my leave; my father must not see my woman's weeds. [Exit. Softly, from off] Constantine ...it is I, Romiet…


$Act 3 Scene 6
{CONSTANCE}: (Singing tunelessly to herself to allay her fear) I never saw a ghost in my life, ghost in my life, ghost in my life; I never saw a ghost in my life, 'cause there’s no such thing. I never saw a - 
[Suddenly, ghost sounds: wind, chains, smoke. A skeleton faced GHOST emerges through a trap door. He wears Constance's red toque with the pom-pom. CONSTANCE turns and sees him, and is terrified]
Holy Mary, Mother of God! —
{GHOST}: A man told me he hadn't had a bite in three days, so I bit him. I awoke today and shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got there, I know not. I just flew in from Padua, and zounds, are my arms tired! 
{CONSTANCE}: Who are you? 
{GHOST}: Who are you-ou-ou? 
{CONSTANCE}: Where'd you get that hat? 
{GHOST}: A fo-o-ol's cap. 
{CONSTANCE}: Is this some kind of joke? 
{GHOST}: My stock in trade. 
{CONSTANCE}: A ghostly fool? A jester from the grave? Are you -? You couldn't be. What play is this? Could you be ... Yorick?!
{GHOST}: Na-a-ay. You’re it. 
{CONSTANCE}: You're it? 
{GHOST}: Alas poor fool, you know me well. 
{CONSTANCE}: I do? Don't speak in riddles, tell me what you mean. 
{GHOST}: I mean you script a woman, and a fool it's not a man you seek, the Manuscript …
{CONSTANCE}: Do you know something of the Manuscript?! Do you know who the Author is?
{GHOST}: A lass. 
{CONSTANCE}: I know, "alas, alas poor Yorick", so?! Who wrote this thing? 
{GHOST}: A beardless hard. 
{CONSTANCE}: A boy? 
{GHOST}: A lass! 
{CONSTANCE}: Oh here we go again, "alas"! Who is the Author? 
{GHOST}: A Fool, a Fool. 
{CONSTANCE}: The Fool and the Author are one in the same? 
{GHOST}: Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
{CONSTANCE}: What's his name?! 
{GHOST}: Do not forget. This visitation is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose. Beware of Tybalt. He hath not a sense of humour. Adieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me-e-e. [GHOST begins to sink back down the trap] 
{CONSTANCE}: No, wait! Don't go yet! Yorick! 
{GHOST}: Yo-o-u-u're it. 
[Exit GHOST. Enter TYBALT] 
{TYBALT}: Hermaphrodite! 
{CONSTANCE}: Who, me? Oh, hi Tybalt. 
{TYBALT}: Greek boy! The love I bear thee can afford no better term than this: thou art a villain. 
{CONSTANCE}: There must be some mistake. Therefore farewell. 
[CONSTANCE tries to exit] 
{TYBALT}: 'Boy this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw. 
{CONSTANCE}: No please! I haven't done anything! 
{TYBALT}: I am for you! 
[He draws. Something like an anchovy hangs off the end of his sword. CONSTANCE recognizes it, and plucks it off] 
{CONSTANCE}: Good heavens, this is somebody's appendix . . . [Mouthing the word] mine! No. No, please don't hurt me, please! 
{TYBALT}: A l’arme! 
[TYBALT tosses her a sword She catches it] 
{CONSTANCE}: All right, then, come on! [Swishes her sword] I trained in Cyprus you know, come on. [Swish] Hit me. [Thump-ing her chest] Hit me right here. 
[TYBALT lunges. CONSTANCE yelps with fear and fends him off clumsily. Enter ROMEO in women's clothing] 
{ROMEO}: Hold Tybalt! Good Constantine! Put up your swords! 
[ROMEO comes between the combatants, raising his arms to stop them as in Romeo and Juliet; but here, TYBALT'S sword, rather than skewering CONSTANCE under ROMEO’S arm, gets caught in the flowing fabric of ROMEO 's dress. CONSTANCE escapes as the two men struggle. ROMEO runs off. TYBALT looks about, swishes his sword, then runs off after CONSTANCE] 

$Act 3 Scene 7
{JULIET}: Ay me. 
{CONSTANCE}: [From off below] Juliet! Help! 
[JULIET takes a rope ladder from under the bed and throws it down.] 
{JULIET}: Catch, love! (CONSTANCE struggles up and onto the balcony, still bearing the sword) 
{CONSTANCE}: Tell me the name! 
{JULIET}: Give me my kiss! (CONSTANCE gives JULIET a chaste peck on the cheek) Where's passion in thy curiosity? 
{CONSTANCE}: My life's at stake. 
{JULIET}: My heart's on fire. 
[Pause. CONSTANCE works up her nerve and kisses JULIET on the mouth. JULIET takes over. CONSTANCE breaks it off] 
{CONSTANCE}: Ahem. Now who's the Author? 
{JULIET}: I did lie. 
{CONSTANCE}: You little brat! 
[JULIET picks up CONSTANCE'S sword, thrusts it into CONSTANCE'S hands, and bares the upper portion of her own left breast]
{JULIET}: Now wreak atonement here! Spear the lie e'en to its bubbling source!
[JULIET grabs the tip of CONSTANCE'S sword and tries to plunge it into her heart. CONSTANCE resists] 
{CONSTANCE}: Hang on! There's no need to overreact! [CONSTANCE manages to wrest the sword from JULIET and throws it over the balcony] 
{JULIET}: And I cannot rejoice upon thy sword. I'll die upon my dagger, so! [JULIET takes a dagger and winds up to stab herself. CONSTANCE intervenes] 
{CONSTANCE}: No! [CONSTANCE wrests the dagger from JULIET, flings it over the balcony, and pins JULIET down] Now listen here. There's something you don't know. For safety did I first secrete my sex. I mean! - I'll have to trust you with the truth. My name is Constance. I'm a woman. 
{JULIET}: Oh. 
{CONSTANCE}: That's right. So that's that. 
{JULIET}: And art thou of Cyprus? 
{CONSTANCE}: Not originally. 
{JULIET}: Then art thou of Lesbos?! 
{CONSTANCE}: What?! I've never been there in my life. 
{JULIET}: O most forbidden love of all! 
{CONSTANCE}: Oh no. 
{JULIET}: Unsanctified desire, more tragic far than any star-crossed love 'twixt boy and girl! 
{CONSTANCE}: Now wait. 
{JULIET}: Once more am I a virgin maid. O take me to thine island's curved shore, and lay me on the bosom of the sand; there sing to me the psalm that Sappho wrote; her hymn to love will be our Song of Songs. 
{CONSTANCE}: I'm not up on Sappho. 
{JULIET}: Then we'll compose an epic of our own. 
{CONSTANCE}: But I'm not — you know — I'm not ... a lesbian. At all. That's just a rumour. I've never been involved with a woman. Unless you count that one time in grade eight when Ginnie Radclyffe did my portrait. Her mother worked, and Ginnie was a cubist. She said she had to have a detailed tour of my physique for authenticity. Ginnie had such poignant hands and wrists. But I never painted her. 
{JULIET}: She died. 
{CONSTANCE}: She's married now and can't recall a thing. 
{JULIET}: A portrait hangs unfinished in thy heart. 
{CONSTANCE}: I know I felt bereft. But that was then. 
{JULIET}: Make ready now to paint me in her stead. So mix and frame the colours on this bed.
{CONSTANCE}: I don't know how. 
{JULIET}: Be thou the mirror pool of my desire: reflect my love as thou dost ape my form.
{CONSTANCE}: Thou wouldst distort the pool, thy looking-glass, with words of love like careless pebbles tossed; the rippling waters tell a loving lie, and show my face to thee as 't'were thine own. Still waters would reflect an aged crone. 
{JULIET}: More beauty in thy testament of years, than in the face of smooth and depthless youth. Nay, lovelier by far, now that I see the sculpting hand of time upon thy brow; O look on me with eyes that looked on life before I e'er was born an infant blind. O touch me with those hands that held thy quill before I learned to read and write my name. And thus with every look and touch, entwine my poor young thread into thy richer weave. 
{CONSTANCE}: Okay. 
{JULIET}: Tomorrow will they find one corpse entwined, when, having loved each other perfectly, our deaths proclaim one night, eternity. 
{CONSTANCE}: Eternity ... 
{JULIET}: I have a vial of poison hidden here; [Concealed in her shirt] it will dispatch us with the morning lark. 
{CONSTANCE}: But for now, the nightingale doth sing. [JULIET leans down and CONSTANCE reaches into her shirtI What have we here? [CONSTANCE withdraws her hand from JULIET 's chorl, holding a Manuscript page] Oh, shit. [She unrolls the scroll and reads:] "Thy demons rest not till they've eaten thee. Get Desdemon and merge this trinity, or never live to see another Birthdy." I forgot. It's my birthday today. [The warp effect  begins. JULIET is terrified] 
{JULIET}: Constance! 
{CONSTANCE}: Hang on, Julie-e-et! [The warp ends, to reveal JULIET and CONSTANCE, huddled together, eyes closed, still on Juliet's bed. Nothing, apparently, has changed] It's all right. [They release one another and scan the room] False alarm. [They chuckle and lie back again as JULIET begins to re-arrange the pillows on the bed. Suddenly she screams —] 
{JULIET}: Ah-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-!!! [— and leaps back to reveal DESDEMONA, who rises: a phoenix from the pillows] 
{DESDEMONA}: 'Tis strange, i'faith. 'Tis passing wondrous strange. 
{CONSTANCE}: Desdemona. 
{DESDEMONA}: O perjured pedant, thou dost stone my heart. 
{CONSTANCE}: [About to introduce JULIET] Desdemona. this is —[DESDEMONA takes up a pillow] 
{DESDEMONA}: Put out the light, and then put out the light. [DESDEMONA brings the pillow down on CONSTANCE 'S head] 
{CONSTANCE}: No! Help!!! [Muffled etc. . . .] 
{JULIET}: Hold! 
{DESDEMONA}: Thy fool's cap is a Turkish document, and thou, base strumpet, hast seduced my lord! [DESDEMONA raises the pillow] 
{CONSTANCE}: No! No way, I swear! [The pillow comes down again. JULIET grabs another pillow and offers it to DESDEMONA] 
{JULIET}: Kill me in her stead! [DESDEMONA Ignores JULIET] 
{DESDEMONA}: I saw thee fingering his very jewels! A diamond necklace that would ransom kings! [Pillow up] 
{CONSTANCE}: Oh that! 
{DESDEMONA}: Down strumpet! [JULIET hits DESDEMONA with the pillow, but DESDEMONA disarms her easily and knocks her flying] 
{CONSTANCE}: Kill me tomorrow!
{DESDEMONA}: It is too late [Pillow down] 
{JULIET}: [Exiting] Help! Murther! [CONSTANCE, her head still beneath the pillow, reaches under her shirt, yanks off the diamond necklace, and holds its broad golden clasp before DESDEMONA 's eyes] 
{DESDEMONA}: Ah ha! [Reading inscription] "For gentle Desdemona, upon thy birthday, love Othello." [CONSTANCE'S hands drop to the bed and go limp] [Smiling] Oh. It is my birthday today. I had forgot. [To CONSTANCE] I'm sorry. [Suddenly remembering] Constance! [Whips the pillow up] not dead? Not yet quite dead? [A beat, then CONSTANCE takes a huge gasp of air]
{CONSTANCE}: Happy Birthday. [CONSTANCE takes the pillow from DESDEMONA and whacks her with it, knocking her down] 
{TYBALT}: [Off] Greek boy! 
{CONSTANCE}: Oh no, it's Tybalt. Pretend I'm dead, and tell Juliet to meet us at the Crypt. [CONSTANCE lies back on the bed] 
{DESDEMONA}: Who? 
{TYBALT}: [Off] The worms line up to feast on thee! 
{CONSTANCE}: Juliet! The lady of the house, she was here a second ago. 
{DESDEMONA}: I saw no one, save a spindly boy. [TYBALT enters over the balcony, sword drawn. CONSTANCE plays dead] 
{TYBALT}: Ha! 
{DESDEMONA}:  [Pointing to CONSTANCE] Dead! Quite dead! 
{TYBALT}: Well killed! I'll drag him to the charnel house. 
{DESDEMONA}: Sir, how might I know Juliet? 
{TYBALT}: She is a young and lovely sylph in flowing rose-hued silk. [Exit DESDEMONA. JULIET appears at the balcony in time to see TYBALT dragging CONSTANCE Off] 
{JULIET}: [Aside] Constance dead? Is it e'en so? [Exit TYBALT with CONSTANCE. JULIET raises her dagger aloft] Then I defy you stars! Constance, I will lie with thee tonight. [Exit JULIET] 

$Act 3 Scene 8

{DESDEMONA}:[Aside] By Tybalt’s own account, must this be Juliet. Here is the rose-hued silk… but nowhere do I see the lovely sylph. [To ROMEO] What ho, I have a message for you, Lady. [ROMEO sees DESDEMONA] 
{ROMEO}: [Aside] O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
{DESDEMONA}: Constance doth await us at the Crypt, ma’am.
{ROMEO}: I am no ma'am, but man, and worship thee.
{DESDEMONA}: We’d make short work of thee in Cyprus, lad.

$Act 3 Scene 9

{TYBALT}: Lie thou there, inverted nature. [He starts to exit, pauses, then turns back] If curiosity doth stay my leave, it's of an wholesome scientific kind — to take the measure of his member. [DESDEMONA, followed by ROMEO, enters the graveyard as TYBALT goes to remove CONSTANCE'S longjohns]
{ROMEO}: [Lying on a tombstone] Come lie with me upon this marble bed. [ROMEO 's voice startles TYBALT away from CONSTANCE]
{TYBALT}: I'd not be caught, mine hands upon his hose, and of his self-same cloth thought to be cut. [Exit TYBALT into the graveyard, as DESDEMONA continues to search for the correct crypt. CONSTANCE. sits up]
{DESDEMONA}: "Blessed be the man that spares these stones. And cursed be he that moves my bones: William —" [TYBALT sees ROMEO through the gloom and approaches]
{TYBALT}: What maiden corse lies fest'ring here for crows to peck? [ROMEO reaches up and pulls TYBALT toward him] Ha-ha! No corse but fresh, and laid out for the pecking. [TYBALT picks ROMEO up and carries him off, ardently. CONSTANCE resumes her death pose In response to the sound of someone entering. It is JULIET. She approaches CONSTANCE and raises her dagger, poised to slay herself]
{JULIET}: O happy dagger! This is thy sheath; there rust, and let me die. [JULIET starts her fatal uprising, but before she can stab herself:]
{CONSTANCE}: Juliet? [JULIET screams]
{JULIET}: Not dead? [CONSTANCE shakes her head] Not yet quite dead?
{CONSTANCE}: Not one bit dead.
{JULIET}: O Love! O resurrected Love, O Constance! [JULIET, overcome, embraces CONSTANCE, her dagger still in hand. DESDEMONA dashes into the crypt and draws her sword upon JULIET]
{DESDEMONA}: Unhand the damsel, thou rapacious knave!  [JULIET cowers against CONSTANCE as DESDEMONA rears back, about to lunge]
{CONSTANCE}: Hold! Desdemona, this is Juliet, the young lady of the house ... Remember?
{DESDEMONA}: Zounds! Doth no one in Verona sail straight?
{CONSTANCE}: Juliet, this is Desdemona, an old friend of mine from Cyprus.
{JULIET}: With friends like this, thou wantest not for foes.
{DESDEMONA}: Dost thou dare impugn my honour, poppet?
{JULIET}: Aye, and what if I durst?
{DESDEMONA}: Then dare to die!
{CONSTANCE}: Wait —
{JULIET}: That do I dare any day for love!
{DESDEMONA}: Ha.
{JULIET}: I twice did nearly slay myself today for love of her whom thou didst seek to kill.
{DESDEMONA}: I love her better than thou canst devise, for naught I did hate, but all in honour.
{JULIET}: Hateful honour!
{DESDEMONA}: Dishonourable love!
{JULIET}: 'Tis I that Constance loveth best.
{DESDEMONA}: Pish, comes Constance, let's hie home.
{CONSTANCE}: Home.
{JULIET}: Constance will not leave my side.
{DESDEMONA}: She hath naught to live for here.
{JULIET}: But everything for which to die.
{DESDEMONA}: In Cyprus hath she that for which to kill. [To CONSTANCE] Return with me to Cyprus; take this sword, and dip it deep to drink lago's gorge. [DESDEMONA puts the sword in CONSTANCE'S hand]
{JULIET}: Remain! To one blade, we'll two hearts afix, then sail together 'cross the River Styx. [JULIET puts the dagger in CONSTANCE's other hand]
{DESDEMONA}: Nay, come and kill.
{JULIET}: Nay, stay and die.
{DESDEMONA}: Nay come!
{JULIET}: Nay stay!
{DESDEMONA}: Nay kill!!
{JULIET}: Nay die!!
{CONSTANCE}: Nay nay!! — Nay. Just . . . nay ... both of you. I've had it with all the tragic tunnel vision around here. You have no idea what — life is a hell of a lot more complicated than you think! Life - real life - is a big mess. Thank goodness. And every answer spawns another question; and every question blossoms with a hundred different answers; and if you're lucky you'll always feel somewhat confused. Life is — ! . Life is ... a harmony of polar opposites, with gorgeous mixed-up places in between. where inspiration steams up from a rich Sargasso stew that's odd and flawed and full of gems and worn-out boots and sunken ships — Desdemona, I thought you were different; I thought you were my friend, I worshipped you. But you're just like Othello — gullible and violent. Juliet, if you really loved me, you wouldn't want me to die. But you were more in love with death, 'cause death is easier to love. Never mind. I must have been a monumental fool to think that I could save you from yourselves ... Fool …
{DESDEMONA}: Nay, thou speakst wise.
{JULIET}: Aye, fools were never wise.
{DESDEMONA}: Could any fool reveal. how we were wont to err?
{JULIET}: Or get us to concede, what we will gladly swear?
{CONSTANCE}: What's that?
{DESDEMONA}: To live by questions, not by their solution.
{JULIET}: To trade our certainties, for thy confusion.
{CONSTANCE}: Do you really mean that? [JULIET and DESDEMONA nod, "yes."]
{GHOST}: [Under the stage] Swear. Swear.
{DESDEMONA & JULIET}: We swear.
{CONSTANCE}: Then I was right about your plays. They were cormedies after all, not tragedies. I was wrong about one thing, though: I thought only a Wise Fool could turn tragedy to comedy.
{GHOST}: [Below] Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
{CONSTANCE}: Yorick.
{GHOST}: Na-a-ay. You're it.
{CONSTANCE}: I'm it? ... I'm it. I'm the Fool!
{GHOST}: A lass.
{CONSTANCE}: A lass!
{GHOST}: A beardless bard.
{CONSTANCE}: "The Fool and the Author are one and the same"...
{GHOST}: Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
{CONSTANCE}: That's me. I'm the Author! [A golden hand rises up through the surface of the slab upon which Constance lay. The hand holds a scrolled Manuscript page. CONSTANCE takes the page and unscrolls it] It says… "For those who have the eyes to see: Take care — for what you see, just might be thee?” [She looks at DESDEMONA and JULIET] "Where two plus one adds up to one, not three." Goodnight Desdemona. Good morning Juliet. 
{DESDEMONA & JULIET}: Happy Birthday Constance.
{}: [Final warp: Lights flicker, sound effects create rustling/chaotic noise. During this transition scene, CONSTANCE’s office turns back to normal in its entirety.]
{}: [CONSTANCE is alone in her office at Queen’s. Both she and the office are precisely as they were at the onset of the first warp at the end of Act I: the phone receiver dangles by its cord, and CONSTANCE is leaning over with just her - hatless - head in the wastebasket. She straightens up and looks about her, a little disoriented. She tentatively touches herself as if to confirm her reality, bringing one hand up to her head. She feels her pen behind her ear, removes it, and looks at it. It has turned to solid gold, feather and all]

$Act 3 Scene The Epilogue

{CHORUS}: The alchemy of ancient hieroglyphs has permeated the unconscious mind of Constance L. and manifested form, where there was once subconscious dreamy thought. The best of friends and foes exist within, where archetypal shadows come to light and doff their monster masks when we say “boo”. Where mingling and unmingling opposites performs a wondrous fear of alchemy, and spins grey matter, into precious gold. [Lights and music.
{}: [Stage lights turn off. 2 people come and take the desk and one person comes to take the wastebasket. CONSTANCE grabs any miscellaneous items. More people might be needed to grab other props if needed; TBA.]
{}: [Lights turn back on, people are in place for dance. Begin dance.]
{}: [After dace, The actors re-enter with gold-wrapped boxes; birthday presents for CONSTANCE whom everyone crowds around. The spotlight is focused on her and everyone else is caught in the excess light. Just before everyone speaks, the light changes to white (regular) and CONSTANCE looks up at the audience with a smile (staring straight ahead.) She is happily shocked that everyone has joined her world.]
{EVERYONE}: Happy birthday Constance!
{}: [Lights slam off with dramatic pound sound effect]
